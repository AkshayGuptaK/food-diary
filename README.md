# food-diary
## A diet logging and tracking desktop application
Dist.zip contains executables and other files needed to run the application in a desktop environment, created with Setup.py using cx_freeze. If directly running the python scripts, run ResetDatabase.py to create the database, and then FoodDiary.pyw to run the application.
